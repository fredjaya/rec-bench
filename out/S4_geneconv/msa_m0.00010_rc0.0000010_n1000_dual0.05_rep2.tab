# 56 inner fragments listed.


"# Global outer-sequence fragments (363 polymorphisms, 1680 aligned bases):"
# (Outer-sequence fragments are runs of unique sites.)
# (Sim and BC KA P-values are corrected for multiple comparisons.)
# (Fragments are listed only if Sim P-value <= 0.05.)
# See earlier in the file for the full restrictions on fragments.


# No outer-sequence fragments listed.


# No pairwise fragment lists.
