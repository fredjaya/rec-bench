Runtime plots of 3SEQ, GENECONV and PhiPack. Plots represent the walltime (in hours) of individual replicates. Lines are mean runtime across all mutation rates per RDM.

* profile all (< 4h)
* little variation in runtime across RDMs at n = 100 (< 1h)
    * Note: `trace.py` rounds all seconds == 1m
* higher mutation rate 'signifcantly' affects runtime
    * distinct split across all rdms (n = 1000 - 5000)
* max walltime is 120h
